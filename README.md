# MLP-in-handwritten-digit-classification
Multilayer Perceptron in handwritten digit classification use Sklearn API.
* data reference http://amlbook.com/support.html  
 “raw features” refer to the 256 grayscale values.
* run problem4-train.py zip.train  
Apply neural network for classification for all 10 digits, using the raw features as input and compare classification  
accuracy using 3-fold cross-validation.
* run problem4-train.py zip.test  
Test train result.
